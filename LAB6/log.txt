As usual, I first started to log on my Seasnet account. 

First, I had to check the version if it is 8.26 or not.
By checking the version, I did sort --version command.
I saw that I had 8.22 version instead of 8.26.
I ran export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH command.
Now I got 8.26 version. 

I began to generate a file containing 10,000,000 random sigle-precision
floating point numbers with no white space. I did this using od command with 
-An and -fN for floating point. Since it is single-precision floating point
I did -fN 40000000 for 10,000,000 numbers where -fN is for floating point and 
Each single-precision floating-point is 4 bytes. 
I used sed 's/^[0-3]* *//' to remove the octal numbers.
And tr ' ' '\n' and tr -s ' ' commands to make a new line and without a white space. 

od -An -fN 40000000 < /dev/urandom | sed 's/^[0-3]* *//'| tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' ' | tr ' ' '\n' > fileName

I put the output into my fileName file

I then began to compare the time with the following

time -p sort -g fileName > /dev/null
real 21.72
user 112.44
sys 0.52

time -p sort -g --parallel=1 fileName > /dev/null
real 102.36
user 102.15
sys 0.19

time -p sort -g --parallel=2 fileName > /dev/null 
real 55.34
user 105.71
sys 0.23

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 fileName > /dev/null
real 32.71
user 110.04
sys 0.34

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 fileName > /dev/null
real 20.57
user 112.73
sys 0.45

I see that the general sort and the sort prallel=8 has about the same in real time
while others are slowers. I noticed that the system call keeps increasing as 
the number of threads increase because the more threads the more system call. 
I believe that the default 8.7 or higher version is multi-threaded to the max. number
of processors but capped at 8. That is why general sort and 8-threaded sort have similiar
run time.
