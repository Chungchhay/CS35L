Lab 11. man -k keyword where keyword is what we are looking for. 2. I used which command. which cp located in /bin/cp, and which wc located in /usr/bin/wc. 3. Go to /usr/bin then typed find –name “?” where “?” is one character long. If I run each one of those with a man command, I get:    . [ test – check file types and compare values     . w Show who is logged on and what they are doing.    . X a portable, network-transparent window system4. Go to /usr/bin then typed ls –l | grep emacs, this is /etc/alternatives/emacs will be executed 5. g+s gives the person accessing to the file the permission of a group for that file.      o-x means everyone can execute the file.       6. –ctime let me know when the file was modified n*24 hours ago. –atime let me know when the file was last accessed n*24 hours ago. In this case, it is 3 weeks, so –ctime -21 where it can be found using man find command. 7. Use find / -typed –ctime -21. Find the directories that was modified in 21*24 hours ago.   8. /usr/bin typed ls –l | wc –l 	23.9. –lt command is used to find the oldest file, and it must look for a – with grep command. The oldest file in /usr/lib directory is libfreeblpriv3.so. We get this oldest file by using ls  -lt | grep ^-.10. Look for the man page for locale and notice that it data is determined by the setting environment variables defined in the base definition volum of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale.   11. We can find the commands in emacs using C-hand searching for the keyword. Using this we find the following commands with sort in their names:Buffer-menu-sortsort-columnssort-fieldssort-linessort-numeric-fieldssort-pagessort-paragraphssort-regexp-fieldstabulated-list-col-sorttabulated-list-sort      12. The commands can be found using C-h b and then doing a search C-s “C-M-a” then going through the different commands.C-M-a beginning-of-defun: Move backward to the beginning of a defun.C-M-b backward-sexp: Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).C-M-c exit-recursive-edit: Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.C-M-d down-list: Move forward down one level of parentheses.C-M-e end-of-defun: Move forward to next end of defun.C-M-f forward-sexp: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).C-M-g signal a quit conditionC-M-h mark-defun: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.      13. Using C-h-b, when entering C-g, it will signal “quit”      14. Using C-h-b “yank” we can see that it pastes the last stretch of text that was killed.       15. The difference between ls –l and Emacs dired command when looking at the directory /usr/bin is the current and parent directory in the long listing of files and directories. Emacs dired command gives it, while ls –l does not.
