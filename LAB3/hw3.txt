1. Because the line is repeating twice, and it is a goto statement in
a switch statement. Since it is a part of switch statement, it was not 
necessary to remove it. The compiler will ignore it since nothing uses 
this label. 

2. If I use this patched version of Coreutils instead of the default one, I 
might want to watch out about the clients in other countries that 
does not speak English because of the month, our new patch had it in 
alphabets instead of numbers. And it would cause inconsistance in other 
programs that display dates in different format.

3. When running ./randline.py -n 5 /dev/null, the output gives me an error 
 "IndexError: list index out of range". Since I basically try to access
 empty file. The randline.py tries to read from the files, so it assumes
 that the files has something in it, but instead it will access to the null
 file that causes an error.

4.Run randline.py under python3 gives us:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
In python3 IOError is combined into OSError, and the corresponding 
arguments changed. 
The correct way to do it:
except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
