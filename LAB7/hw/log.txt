What we have to do first in the lab is to form a group. My partner worked as a server.
In this lab, we want to use ubuntu by using a disc that was provided in the lab. 
I first started to restart the computer and press F2 multiple times until it shows
something on the screen, and I put the CD in the computer and pressed exit. Then 
pressed try ubuntu. Now I had ubuntu set up in my computer.

In order to be a client or server, we had to install the package. To install the pakacge
we ran the following commands:
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
sudo apt-get purge openssh-client
sudo apt-get update

Notice that we missed some packages on the server. We then ran the following command 
sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I act as a server by setting up a public and  private key ssh-keygen. I set no keyword in it.
This command is basically a RSA key for ssh for someone who tries to log in into my server. 

sudo useradd -d /home/<UserFolder> -m myUser

This command is to create a folder named UserFolder and add the user with a user name myUser. 

sudo passwd <myUser>

This creates password the my user name myUser

cd /home/<UserFolder>

I entered my user folder to create a ssh directory  to store all the information in the
public and private key. 

sudo mkdir .ssh

I then continued to make the the owner myUser so my user can log in into the server. And they 
can add and modify file that they want in that directory by doing the following commands
sudo chown -R <myUser> .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh 

We grab the IP address to log into my server. 

ifconfig 

After my partner logged in, we test it out by creating files on each other computer
and check to see what we both see. And it worked. 

Done with server.

For client:
Now I act as a client. After my partner finished setting up his server, we then grabbed the
IP address by using ifconfig command.
I started to work as a client by the following command:

ssh-copy-id -i myUser@164-67-127-163
ssh-add

This will add a private key to the server within the ssh folder. 

ssh myUser@164-67-127-163 
ssh _X myUser@164-67-127-163

add a file to the server to see if we can see it. Then log in to open other programs such as 
Firefox.
