1. I first have to signed with Seas Account. Then run
 locale command and noticed that it showed me
 LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" so I had to run
 export LC_ALL='C' in order to output LC_CTYPE="C"

2. I ran a command sort /usr/share/dict/words > words to store the
 sorted contents of /usr/share/dict/words in my current file words.

3. I downloaded the webpage page using wget
 http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html.
 Noticed there was a file called assign2.html. I renamed it as
 assign2.txt by using mv command: mv assign2.html assign2.txt

4. I then run cat assign2.txt | those commands with the following:

cat assign2.txt | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' which is basically output
 each word with a new line starting with characters A-Z and a-z, 
and also replaces non-alphabet chars(in this case is a space) with 
new lines.cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' output each word
 with a new line starting with characters A-Z and a-z, and without
 replacing non-alphabet chars with new lines since there is an option
 called -s means "squeezes"

cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort output all the words
 in alphabetically sorted order, each word with a new line

cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u output all the
 words in alphabetically sorted order, each word with a new line with
 words unique(one word outputs only once without repeating)

cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
There are 3 columns in this output
1st column is to output words unique and sorted of assign2.txt
2nd column is to output words unique and sorted of the file words
3rd column is to output words unique and sorted  that appear in both 
files assign2.txt and words

cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
This output the first column of the previous one. Words that are 
unique to assign2.txt

5. I downloaded the webpage using wget
 http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm and noticed that there is
 a file called hwnwdseng.htm since I just downloaded it. I then copied
 the contents of hwnwdseng.htm to hwords file by using the command cp
 hwnwdseng.htm hwords

6. 
#get whatever words that start from <td> and end with  </td>" with 1
 or more character 
grep "<td>.\{1,\}</td>"

#make uppercase to lowercase and ` to '
tr "A-Z\`" "a-z\'"

#delete the odd lines and keep the even lines
sed -n 'g;n;p'

#remove all lines having html tag
sed "s/<[^>]*>//g"

#replace , and a new line globally
sed 's/, /\n/g'

#replace a space with a new line globally
sed 's/ /\n/g' 

#get only hawaiian words starting with their alphabet
grep "[pk\'mnwlhaeiou]"

#sort all the words without duplicate
sort -u

change the permission of buildwords for the executable:
 chmod u+x buildwords
Run: cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords

7. I then downloaded the webpage using wget
 http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html 
and noticed that there was a file called assign2.html

cat assign2.html | tr "PKMNWLHAEIOU" "pkmnwlhaeiou" |
 tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l
198
Run the command above, I got 198 words count that are misspelled in
 English words. The command above means read assign2.html, make all
 uppercases to lowercases, output each word in a new line starting
 with pk\'mnwlhaeiou and sorted those words removing duplicates and 
then compare assign2.html with hwords dictionary to see the number
 of misspelled words in English.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' |
 sort -u | comm -23 - words | wc -l
81

Run the command above, I got 81 words count that are misspelled in
 Hawaiian words. The command above means read assign2.html, output
 each word in a new line starting from A-Z or a-z and sorted those
 words removing duplicates and then compare assign2.html with words
 to see the number of misspelled words in Hawaiian.  

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
 | sort -u | comm -23 - words | comm -12 - hwords

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
